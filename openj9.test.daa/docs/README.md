# openj9.test.daa
- This project contains test cases which are used to verify that the IBM Data Access Accelerator API functions correctly in a load environment.  
- The test cases are included in openj9.test.load inventory files which are in turn used by several of the openj9.test.load load tests.
- The tests can also be run as standalone junit tests which may be useful when debugging failures.  
- See openj9.test.load/config/inventories/daa to see the inventory files.  
- See openj9.test.load/src/test.load/net/openj9/stf/* to see the STF load test definition java programs.
- Search the internet for IBM Data Access Accelerator API for technical details of the feature being tested.
