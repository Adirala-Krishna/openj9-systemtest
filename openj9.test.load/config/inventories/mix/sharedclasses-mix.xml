<!-- 
  This is a minimal inventory intended for sharedclasses tests which want to be able
  to generate a load which can be used for testing the sharedclasses capabilities.  Some
  tests need to be able to predict approximately how much of the shared classes cache
  should be used in the test, so if the contents of the inventories are changed this might
  affect the results of those tests (the 'Softmx' tests).
